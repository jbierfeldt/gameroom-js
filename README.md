# gameroom.js

## Overview

gameroom.js is a simple library for Node and the browser that allows you to rapidly develop stateful, socketed multiplayer games and web applications. Built with Socket.IO, gameroom.js allows you to run multiple named instances of a game or application on a single server, allowing clients to easily connect to and switch between these instances (or 'game rooms'). The library handles the basics of connection, authentication, and clean-up, allowing you to focus on your game or application logic. 

gameroom.js consists of:

- a Node.js server (this repository)
- a Javascript client for the browser
